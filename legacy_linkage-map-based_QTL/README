TITLE: Separate and deposit traditional linkage-map-based QTL as legacy data

DATE: December 17, 2023

I. Introduction

 There has been a trend that traditional linkage-map-based QTL analysis
 developed since mid-1990s is diminishing as sequence-based genome maps
 and SNP-based analysis has taking the stage. This work is to separate from
 the QTLdb and store them away as legacy data.

II. Data export plans and scheme

 (1) Current data status and criteria for export:
     Major data counts, selected based on data types and mapping types:
    +----------+-------------+---------+
    | count(1) | assotype    | maptype |
    +----------+-------------+---------+
    |   240150 | Association | Genome  |
    |     5415 | Association | Linkage |
    |     2892 | eQTL        | Genome  |
    |     1125 | eQTL        | Linkage |
    |    12232 | QTL         | Genome  |
    |    13342 | QTL         | Linkage |<--- this is the catagory to save away
    +----------+-------------+---------+

 (2) Data sources:
    o Query data:
     - MySQL `QTLdata' table (primary information)
     - MySQL `reference' table (essential information)
     - MySQL `traits' table (essential information; + `trait variants' info)
     - MySQL `breeds' table (extended information)
     - MySQL 'GeneIDs' table (extended information)
    [explained]
     - Map data (essential information) from MySQL `QTLdata' table, referenced
       to the backbone map publications.
    o Manual data:
     - Backbone map (essential, one per species): Reference info.

 (3) Data format:
    VCF-like data format(?), which includes (1) extended/attached meta 
    information on the dataset and, (2) a tab-delimited data sheet, in a
    single file.

III. Methods and execution:

 (1) Planning:
     (omitted)

 (2) Information to include as "header" of each data file:
     (omitted)

 (3) Execution:
    All-in-one perl script to pull everything together.

 (4) Data files saved:
    VCF-like data format, one file per species, in a format described above, 
    with row counts (output from the script):
    - QTLdb_legacyQTLdata.cattle.txt: 3782
    - QTLdb_legacyQTLdata.chicken.txt: 2701
    - QTLdb_legacyQTLdata.horse.txt: 31
    - QTLdb_legacyQTLdata.pig.txt: 6099
    - QTLdb_legacyQTLdata.sheep.txt: 592
    - QTLdb_legacyQTLdata.trout.txt: 104

IV. Summary:

 - README (this file).

V. Additional information:

 (1) The plan to save away traitional linkage-map-based QTL data was announced
     (Animal QTLdb Release #51, https://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb/release/#51)
     in August, 2023.

 (2) The said data was exported and placed on archive in December 2023
     (Animal QTLdb Release #52, https://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb/release/#52)
     The data will be taken off from all online services, but remain in the
     (hot)system before their final removal in April 2023.

 (3) The said data will be removed/deleted from the QTLdb by April 2023.
     (Animal QTLdb Release #53, https://www.animalgenome.org/QTLdb/release/#53)

  The above time gaps are given as a buffer to avoid unexpected from happening,
  and for possible public feedbacks, such that we have time/room to act for a
  smooth transition.
