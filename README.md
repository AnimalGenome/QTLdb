## A supplementary data repository for Animal QTLdb

BOUT THE ANIMAL QTLdb:
Animal QTLdb is developed at the Iowa State University to collect all
publicly available functional genome mapping data (i.e. QTL, eQTL, GWAS,
CNV, etc) in several livestock animal species. The utility of the database
may include but not limited to facilitating comparisons between experiments,
within and across species.  Publications on Animal QTLdb: (PubmedID)
